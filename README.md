# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study


 FinTech Case Study

# Overview and Origin

* Brex is an online market place for banking and financial services. Founded in 2017 by Henrique Dubugras & Pedro Franceschi. They beleive that the banking industry has not fully utlized the assesibility features internet. According to the company's mission statement small businesses of the future are looking more like startups, and banks can't build what they need. Having the ability to sign up for a credit card or bank account online in minutes will allow businesses to keep moving and reach their potential. The company has recieved $940 million in venture capital dollars and is valued worth is over $7 billion dollars - CNBC. 


## Business Activities:

  * Brex is an online market place for financial services that reduces the need for conventional banks. Brex primary consumer base is start-ups and small businesses as they tyically have the need for new lines of credit, accounts, ERP solutions, etc. Some are services that banks typically dont offer online or are offered to bigger more established businesses. Some of the tech used is Python and Java on the back end and AirFlow for framwork. Using cloud computing and machine learning to make lending decisions based on real time data rather than waiting for an approval via mail.


## Landscape:

* Brex operates in the open banking domain of Financial Tech. In 2017 Deloitte reported that marketplace banking will model of the future. Traditional banks have closed model where they simply sell the services they believe their customers need. Marketplace banking is more data intensive and will cause constant competition to provide financial services. Having a marketplace will give customers more customized banking services allowing them to optimise their fiances. Plaid is a Brex competitor that offers Open-source APIs for banking aggregation. It enables financial institutions to facilitate services such as personal finances, consumer payments, lending, banking, and business finances. It also enables them to develop products related to investments, assets, and student loans. Having roughly 5 more years of senority in the open banking domain than Brex, Plaid is valiued at $13.4 billion - nearly double of Brex. Both Plaid and Brex are listed as Forbes 11 Biggest Fintech Companies of 2011 at 5 & 7 respectully.


## Recommendations

*  I believe that this would increase the user base beyond startup and serve as a investment vheicle for those with extra cash on hand. Because Brex already offers lines of credit, I think from a technical standpoint it would be a pivot of the technolgies already used.
